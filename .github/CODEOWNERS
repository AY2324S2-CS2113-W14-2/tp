# The '*' pattern defines a global owner.
# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most precedence.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @yuki-zmstr will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
